# SCOM-PKICertificateMP
This is for SCOM - System Center Operations Manager 2019 / 2016 / 2012:

The PKI Certificate Verification MP discovers PKI Certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists inside Windows computersâ€™ *local* certificate stores. It helps preventing service interruptions caused by invalid certificates by alerting when they are about to expire or have otherwise become invalid.
